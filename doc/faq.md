## Why is it called 'batteries'?

The name derives from the idomatic expression "batteries not included," referring to something that is missing some essential pieces in order to be useful.  Anyone who has ever had their C++ program crash with nothing but the following output...

```shell
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
$ 
```

...knows what I'm talking about.  Um, stack trace please?

It's also a bit of a pun on the statement you use to import the batteries library:

```c++
#include <batteries.hpp>
```
